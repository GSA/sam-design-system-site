# Note: The contents of the assets directory is used by Jekyll for CSS, JS, Images, and
#       fonts. The contents are generated by the various Gulp commands. Not ignoring
#       this directory could cause a lot of merge conflicts. However, at this juncture
#       the default gh-pages workflow will not run the necessary commands. Therefore,
#       we should see if it is possible to do so by using web hooks or an integration
#       provider to perform the Jekyll build and Gulp commands.
