# Jekyll files and directories
#
# Note: We want the node package to be as small as possible. Therefore, we ignore all
#       files and folders related to building the Jekyll site itself.
#
#       Is it possible, and should we, ignore the node_modules directory? Essentially
#       making the Node package only deliver the src directory.
