<h2 id="giving-back">Giving back to the greater good</h2>
<p>SAM designers and developers believe in <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/">the mission of The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards</a>.</p>
<p>We can be found contributing back to The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards as much as to the SAM Web Design Standards; or interacting with the vibrant community there. We hope to help create a better experience for all users of Federal websites, not just our own.</p>

<h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
<p>The Standards were created to help SAM designers and developers get up and running quickly toward building for the environment. We have opened them to the world as an open srouce package available through <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a> (<code>samwds</code>).</p>
<p>Help us make it better by <a class="usa-external_link" href="{{ site.repos[0].url }}">contributing on GitHub</a>.</p>
