<p class="usa-font-lead">We believe in creating simple solutions that are easy to change in the future (the 10th principle of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>).</p>

<p>Developing for the web is not the same as developing for other platforms (Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux, and so on).</p>

| Requirement                                          | Platform    | Web |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:---:|
| Build phase required                                 | Yes         | No  |
| Build phase usually results in executable binary     | Yes         | No  |
| Application (binary) based                           | Yes         | No  |
| Base language(s) require compilation                 | Yes         | No  |
| Document based                                       | No          | Yes |
| All assets for rendering interface available to user | No          | Yes |
| Interface and interactions generated by plain text   | No          | Yes |
| Requires server (local or remote) to view            | No          | No* |

<p><small>* You can create a full-featured website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which will run in a browser without a server; however, advanced features or various frameworks and languages may require a remote or local server for the web. Still not true for platform development.</small></p>


<h2 id="progressive-enhancement">Progressive enhancement</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">Progressive enhancement is a web development approach with iterative design at its heart.</p>

<p>The following are implemented in turn &mdash; focusing on the next only when it appears the first cannot satisfy the user need. By doing so you are able to leverage and present base functionality while maintaining the spirit of the web: Content, functionality, and code, which is open and accessible to anyone, anywhere so long as they are connected to a network, regardless of the technology used.</p>

<p>A potentially shippable increment in a short time is also afforded, because the content is made available first; the user experience and functionality of which is enhanced iteratively, over time based on user-need and feedback (the second value of the <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and the <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">first principle</a>). Finally, it is easier to change and iterate when the codebase is small; thereby, allowing the possibility of rapid user feedback and adjustment before having too much code to change quickly and a “locked” architecture (the second and third principles of the <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>).

<h3 id="pe-content">Content</h3>

<p>As the saying goes, &ldquo;Content is king.&rdquo; Most web pages are, first and foremost, content &mdash; not functionality.</p>

<p>Determine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are you trying to communicate or convey?</li>
  <li>What information should be displayed on a page?</li>
  <li>How should the content be formatted and ordered?</li>
  <li>And so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>By considering these questions before writing code we ensure users get the information they need in a consumable way.</p>

<h3 id="pe-markup">Semantic markup (structure)</h3>

<p>HTML is the foundation of the web &mdash; without it, there is no page; therefore, <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement">everything else can be considered an extra</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML specification</a> is maintained by the <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> to inform browser (user-agent) developers how to render HTML. Further, the HTML specification lets you know when elements should be used and where; this is what is meant by &ldquo;semantic markup&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Semantic markup aids users in reading and navigating the page and site. Assistive technologies use the HTML elements to aid users in navigating the content. Therefore, it is essential to choose elements based on their semantic correctness &mdash; not their visual appearance. For example, using <code>h1</code> instead of <code>bold</code> or something else for the title of a page.</p>

<h3 id="pe-css">CSS and CSS3 (style)</h3>

<p>The <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a> specification is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium and allows you to separate the structure of a page or site from its aesthetics.</p>

<p>CSS level 1 has been available since 1997. CSS level 3, introduced in 2014, allows for even more interactive capability and selector options to be handled via CSS (animations or alternating table row colors, for example); therefore, no longer requiring complex logic to generate different markup using some type of template system.</p>

<p>CSS allows you to create visually appealing layouts and designs to an entire site, without tying the presentation to the HTML itself…and it’s pretty amazing the flexibility you are afforded by <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://csszengarden.com">HTML and CSS alone</a>.</p>

<p><small>Note: CSS is built with a progressive enhancement approach, with <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/">CSS level 1</a> also being robust, flexible, and still in use today.</small></p>

<p><small>Note: We avoid modifying the base CSS generated by the <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://standards.usa.gov">US Web Design Standards</a> as much as possible; opting to contribute directly to that project through issues and pull requests.</small></p>

<h3 id="pe-js">JavaScript (enhanced interactivity)</h3>

<p>The <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://www.ecma-international.org">JavaScript</a> specification is maintained by ECMA International (not a World Wide Web Consortium specification).</p>

<p>JavaScript manipulates the underlying HTML string of a page and can also make calls to a server without moving the user to a new page. These interactive concepts could be difficult or impossible to do with HTML and CSS alone. Further, they only serve to update the HTML and style of a page. Therefore, JavaScript is not a replacement for the specifications of the World Wide Web Consortium, but an extension of, the web ecosystem itself. </p>

<h3 id="pe-example">Example</h3>

<p>The Standards themselves are an example of progressive enhancement and iterative design.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mark 1: PDF (content)</li>
  <li>Mark 2: Wiki page to make feedback easier.</li>
  <li>Mark 3: Program adopts the <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://standards.usa.gov">US Web Design Standards</a> (giving developers access to a <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/index.html">Twitter Bootstrap-like</a> toolkit), moved content to <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://gsa.github.io/openIAE/">GSA&rsquo;s openIAE</a>; openIAE also converted to use the US Web Design Standards.</li>
  <li>Mark 4: Converted to a tool as a proof of concept, incorporating the US Web Design Standards directly and <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a>.</li>
  <li>Mark 5: Moved to GSA organizational GitHub with a new aesthetic, information architecture, and a more modular design to perform site build and package delivery.</li>
  <li>Mark 6: Added microsite functionality allowing you to quickly create various pages for the future SAM.gov, with JavaScript enhanced capabilities added to some of the elements and components.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each iteration and change was based on informal user testing and pull from the community &mdash; with a core philosophy that remains today (progressive enhancement).</p>

<h2 id="modular-design">Modular design</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">Modular design is the mindset connecting encapsulated units of functionality together will create a system whereby the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and allows for complex systems based on simple pieces.</p>

<p>This approach is at the heart of a micro-service architecture. By maximizing reusable modules and methods, you are able to create simple (or even complex) user interactions, which are easy to change in the future.</p>

<p>A module mindset, coupled with progressive enhancement, allows for iterative design and emergent architectures; in part, because modular design maintains small pieces of encapsulated functionality across the entire system. In other words, the pursuit of modules becomes a treasure hunt!</p>

<p>(Module Go! Gotta find &rsquo;em all. Too bad there&rsquo;s not an app for that.)</p>

<p>As you build a page, the idea for a reusable concept <em>emerges</em>. Then it is just a matter of refactoring and re-engineering the code to extract the discovered module from its surroundings. Building another page, that uses the module from the first, may spark the idea for another module&hellip;and so on. (See also <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don’t Repeat Yourself</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="md-example">Example</h3>

<p>The idea for the UI kit emerged while building a prototype environment with a proof of concept for a single system feature.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mark 1: Prototype environment setup using template engine from selected framework as a proof of concept.</li>
  <li>Mark 2: Maximizing reuse caused the creation of multiple &ldquo;partials&rdquo; wherein an array of configuration options were passed in order to generate the HTML.</li>
  <li>Mark 3: Eeach &ldquo;partial&rdquo; was extracted in the native language of the framework; thereby, allowing the library to be used independent of framework chosen by developers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bdd">Behavior driven development</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">Behavior driven development was born from test driven development.</p>

<p>Test driven development is a development and testing practice whereby tests are written before production code is developed. This test will initially fail (red); at which point, the simplest code required to pass the test is written. The test should now pass (green); at which point, you refactor (make it easier for developers to read) and, possibly, re-engineer (an extension of refactoring, which also benefits the end-user).</p>

<p>Behavior driven development asks you to consider the end-user when writing tests: What should this thing do from a user perspective? If this happens, how should this thing respond? And so on.</p>

<p>Tests written for behavior driven development typically take the form of a complete sentence covering: the state of the system under test, the input or interaction from the user, and the expected result based on that interaction.</p>

<p>Testing the validity of the system is actually not the mindset here. Instead, the tests act as a safety net to allow you to feel relatively safe that the re-engineering of your code does <em>not</em> unexpectedly deviate from your expectations.</p>

<p>By leveraging this “red-green-refactor” pattern (<a class="usa-external_link" href="http://qualitycoding.org/objective-c-tdd/">the TDD waltz</a>) you can feel relatively safe when you discover a new module (or change a design pattern) that the system still performs as expected while you strive for technical excellence (the ninth principle of the <a class="usa-external_link" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>.

<h3 id="bdd-example">Example</h3>

<p>Given I am <em>not</em> on the home page<br>
when I click the SAM.gov logo<br>
then I <em>should</em> be on the home page.</p>

{% include partials/mobile_first.html %}

<h3 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth and Processor Speeds</h3>

<p>The Standards views mobile devices as first-class citizens with regard to how users interact with the web. It is important to consider bandwidth constraints, caps on data plans, and processor speeds. Mobile and tablet devices typically have less processing power and hardware resources available, which should also be taken into consideration when creating client-side scripts.</p>

<h2 id="URLs">URLs</h2>

<h3 id="urls-secure">Secure by Default</h3>

<p>There are two transfer protocols used to serve Web content: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HTTP Secure (HTTPS). By default all uniform resource locators (URLs) should use HTTPS; an HTTP URL should redirect to the HTTPS equivalent.</p>


<h3 id="urls-no-wwww">No WWW</h3>

<p>URLs should not require the use of &ldquo;www&rdquo;, as this represents a sub-domain and could lead to confusion if subdomains are implemented on the site. In other words, there is a question of whether the following are different sites or the same:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://www.my.domainname.com</li>
  <li>https://my.www.domainname.com</li>
  <li>https://my.domainname.com</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="human-readable">Human-friendly and readable</h3>

<p>URLs should be case-<em>insensitive</em>; therefore, the following URL pairs should result in the display of the same content:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://My.DomainName.com and<br>https://my.domainname.com</li>
  <li>https://my.DomainName.com/MainPage/SubPage and<br>https://my.domainname.com/mainpage/subpage</li>
  <li>https://my.domainname.com/AFileOnTheServer.pdf and<br>https://my.domainname.com/afileontheserver.pdf</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows communication and marketing collateral to be built in a more human-readable manner by using upper- and lower-case letters to separate words within URLs while supporting copy and paste of the URL into a browser.</p>

<p>Further, when developing page addresses and URLs a user should be able to gain a basic understanding of what they will see, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://domainname.com/mainpage/posts/descriptive-post-title</li>
  <li>not https://domainname.com/?page=1&post=5</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="feature-toggle">Feature toggles</h2>

<p class="usa-font-lead">A <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle">feature toggle</a> attempts to solve the problems seen in feature branches and other complex branching strategies related to build features while still releasing software.</p>

<p>One way to create a feature while ensuring it does not get released to the public until it is ready is to create a feature branch within a version control system (like Git). The feature toggle can be set to look at the version number within a file, the environment flag in another, something else entirely, and any combination thereof. Therefore, allowing you to begin working on a feature while continuously updating the main deployment branch, with a great level of confidence that the feature will not be visible to end-users until it is ready.</p>

<p>For example, some times Facebook will make a new feature available, but only to users within a certain city, or with certain email domain names, or any other criteria they choose. This way, not all users see the new feature, and Facebook can receive feedback from the users who do.</p>
