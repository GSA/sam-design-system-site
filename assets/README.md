README.md

The contents of this directory are populated by Gulp.

If you are adding assets to be used by those consuming the Standards, 
please place them in the appropriate folder within the /src directory.

If you are adding assets to be used ONLY by the rendered website,
please place them in the appropriate folder with the /_site-assets directory.

The contents of this directory are a combination of the assets found in both the
/src and /_site-assets directories.

If the Standards mature to the point where we are no longer dependent on GitHub
to perform the Jekyll build, this folder will become ignored, deprecated, and removed.

Because one can never be too sure.
