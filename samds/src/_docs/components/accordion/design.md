## Design

- The accordion uses the colors from the US Web Standards and icons from the Font Awesome library
- The accordion has a header area with a title, a background color, and a plus or minus icon depending on its state
- The accordion generates a section beneath it for content (text, pictures, functionality) upon user click of the 'plus' icon
- By default the accordion is set to 'collapsed' upon page load, and is only expanded on user click of the 'plus' icon
- The accordion has a flag that allows developers to expand the accordion by default.
The accordion can feature links to other pages for users to find more information, when applicable
- The accordion will be collapsed upon user click of the 'minus' icon
- The are no character limits in either the title or content of the accordion.
- The dialog is left aligned in the expanded view.
