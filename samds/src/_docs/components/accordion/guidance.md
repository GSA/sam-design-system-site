## Guidance

*When to use*
- Users only need a few specific pieces of content within a page.
- Information needs to be displayed in a small space.

*When to consider something else*
- If visitors need to see most or all of the information on a page. Use well-formatted text instead.
- If there is not enough content to warrant condensing. Accordions increase cognitive load and interaction cost, as users have to make decisions about what headers to click on.

- The accordion will be used to expand and collapse content. This content could include pictures, text, and other apps or components that provide the user a potential actionable task.
- The accordion will NOT be used to expand and collapse functionality alone. For example, the search filters have the expand/collapse functionality for individual filters or for the entire filtering section itself. This is an expand/collapse feature, but does not fall under the definition of accordion because this purely hiding or showing functionality alone, whereas an accordion provides context for any functionality that may fall within it, such as a text description.
- No required action on the site will be hidden within the accordion common component. If a required functionality is provided within the accordion, it will be presented somewhere else as well and only be placed within the accordion as an additional level of convenience for the user.
