Sidenav lets a person navigate a long page divided into multiple sections or between a group of closely related web pages.  

#### *When to use*

* To navigate through sections on long page, particularly when there is a lot of information in each section.  Examples include:
    * Display pages for Assistance Listings and Contract Opportunities 
* To nagivate between related pages.  Examples include:
    * Multi-page data entry for Assistance Listings, Contract Opportunities, and System Accounts
    * Closely related workspace pages such as Assistance Listings, Regional Agency Offices, and Manage CFDA Numbers

#### *When to consider something else*

* SideNav is the primary way of nagivating between sections on a page or between related pages.  They are used along with [breadcrumbs](/components/breadcrumbs), the main menu, and the footer links to navigate the website.

#### *How to use*

There are multiple variations of Sidenav including a public style, an authenticated style, and a data entry style.
