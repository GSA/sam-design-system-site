# Release Process
Our release process for components is as follows:

1. Pre-development: Ideation & Prototyping
2. Experimental
3. Alpha
4. Beta
5. Release Candidate
6. Release & Maintenance

## Pre-development: Ideation & Prototyping
Initial component analysis and architecture documentation. Requirements gathering, user testing, use case analysis, wireframes, mockups, sketches.

**Purpose:** Define a user need and create solution hypothesis for further investigation and experimentation. Determine if a common component is needed.

**Outcomes:** Understand the user needs, how the component resolves the user problem, define a potential component solution, whether a common component is needed, and understand how that solution fits into the greater system.

**Fidelity:** Low

**Transition Decision:** There is a clear understanding of the user need, it is determined a new component is needed, and a potential solution is sketched

**Gut Check:** Do I know what I’m building?

## Experimental
Initial development work. Components developed in experimental package within sam-ui-elements. Component demo hosted on web-standards-site under appropriate prototypes section.

**Purpose:** Prove feasibility of highest risk elements of the original design hypothesis identify additional risks.

**Outcomes:** Understand the feasibility and risks of developing the component. Have an understanding of the costs of overall development work, the risks inherent in development, and any secondary or tertiary development tasks needed to complete component, including an understanding of how the component fits into the greater system. Code should not be expected to be carried to next environment.

**Fidelity:** Medium

**Transition Decision:** The potential solution has been prototyped, validated and determined to be feasible within constraints.

**Gut Check:** Is this idea feasible?

## Alpha
Ensure component helps users, developers and business meet their needs and objectives. Harden visual and interaction design. Refine component abstraction and object interfaces. Ensure component has a clean, easy to understand architecture.

**Purpose:** Resolve any outstanding risks and create a near-production ready component for user and developer testing.

**Outcomes:** The component should appear to be in its final state. It should be ready for limited external testing. Alpha component should be demoed with users, developers, and business to verify it meets their needs. Any feedback should be incorporated back into the component before release.

**Fidelity:** High

**Transition Decision:** The component is ready for limited release and has a clean architecture, interface, meets the definition of done for the program.

**Gut Check:** Does this solution meet the business requirements?

## Beta
Majority of development work is completed. Component given a controlled, limited release for testing. Emphasis on finding missed use cases, identifying bugs, and ensuring the design, both visual and in code, is of high quality.

**Purpose:** Test component to ensure it meets the needs of users, business, and developers. 

**Outcomes:** Alpha component has been tested in a limited release. The resulting feedback regarding bugs, missed cases, and usability are gathered and incorporated into the component before final release. 

**Fidelity:** High

**Transition Decision:** Feedback resulting from testing the alpha component has been incorporated into the component.

**Gut Check:** Did we miss anything?

## Release Candidate
Release candidate serves as a staging area to finalize documentation and prepare end users for changes. Serves as a final checkpoint for testing.

**Purpose:** Stage component for release and ensure component is high quality, free of defects, and understandably documented.

**Outcomes:** Extensive testing shows component is free of defects and documentation is complete and has been reviewed by users of the component to ensure it is comprehensible.

**Fidelity:** High

**Transition Decision:** The component meets business, user, and developer needs, has a clear place in the system architecture, is free of defects and is thoroughly documented.

**Gut Check:** Is this work I’m proud to say is mine?

## Release & Maintenance

As the final stage of the release process, the component is confidently release without qualification.

**Purpose:** Release final, stable component. Maintain component as new issues are identified.

**Outcomes:** Component is tested and available for development tasks in production with complete documentation. As new issues are identified, patches may be released as necessary. Significant changes or enhancements to the component should start over the development cycle from the beginning.

**Fidelity:** High

**Gut Check:** Is this work I would confidently recommend to others?

**Transition Decision:** Does this component need enhancements, changes, or fixes? Patch or restart the process.
