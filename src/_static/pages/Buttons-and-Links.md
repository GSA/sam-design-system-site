# Buttons and Links

- Use buttons to signal important actions available to the user.
- Use links for navigation.   

The SAM.gov site follows the standards outlined on the [U.S. Web Design Standards Buttons page](https://standards.usa.gov/components/buttons/).

## Buttons

### Primary Buttons

Use the darker, primary color set for the most important buttons the users will look for in order to initiate an activity (e.g., Create Listing) or complete an activity (e.g., Submit).  Typically no more than one button in this color should appear on the page, although there may be occasions to modify this rule. Primary buttons generally appear at the top of a page when the action is to initiate work, or at the bottom of the form, such as when the action is to submit that form.

### Secondary Buttons

Use the secondary color set for the buttons of secondary importance. Examples include search or form-related actions, such as adding data to a table or adding terms in the Advanced section of the Agency Picker.
**Note:** Search-related buttons should be css 'color-primary-alt' (#02bfe7) for consistency.

### 'Borderless' Buttons

'Borderless' buttons are of tertiary importance. They represent useful, but not necessary actions the user may want to take.
Generally, these buttons are represented by an icon and related term, or simply an icon. Examples include actions such as 'Edit', 'Subscribe', 'Favorite', or 'Share'.

### Stacked Functions (Action)

The Action button appears where two or more functions are available. This may be at the page level or object level. When the user clicks on the button, a menu expands with a list of the functions.  

### Dismiss
The 'Dismiss' button is a small icon used on an element to make it easy for the user to dismiss it. Examples include modal windows, search keywords, or multiple select entries.

## Links

### Navigation Links
- **Internal Links:** Internal links navigate the user within the site by replacing one view with the next within the same browser window.
- **External Links:** Links that take the user away from the SAM.gov site should have the _icon image here_ (fa-external-link) after the text. The external page should open in a new browser window.

### Functional Links
Links, such as 'Cancel' or 'Previous', often appear at the bottom of a form page in combination with primary and secondary buttons. These links not only navigate, but may also initiate a function such as a background save.
