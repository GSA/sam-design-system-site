### Notifications Feed
Notifications is a global feature from the header that aggregates personalized messages that are likely to be important to a specific user. Personalized means the messages sent to a user are based on a user’s roles and preferences. Selecting the notification icon opens a panel with a summary listing of notifications. 

- When a new notification arrives, it is indicated by an updated count in a badge next to the notifications icon.
- Notifications are ordered according to the time they are received, with most recent at the top.
- 10 (?) of the most recent notifications appear in the view of the notifications list. A link below the notifications takes the user to a page with the full feed of all notifications.
- An individual notification should link to the relevant page on the website.
- A level 2 notifications page will have all notifications listed (across domains) and can be sorted/filtered
- A level 2 domain page may have a banner that lists a count, such as ‘You have 4 new notifications’
