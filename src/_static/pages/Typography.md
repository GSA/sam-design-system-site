# Typography

Typography is the style and arrangement of type. To ensure clear and consistent headings, highly legible body paragraphs, clear labels, and easy-to-use input fields, the SAM.gov site follows the standards outlined on the [U.S. Web Design Standards Typography page](https://standards.usa.gov/components/typography/).

Standards include Typefaces, Pairings and styles, Typesetting, Links, and Lists.

Adjustments to those standards are described below.

## SAM-specific Standards

### Typeface

Source Sans Pro is used exclusively throughout the SAM site for both headings and body. This enables fast page loading performance for the data-rich site, as well as clear legibility across forms, data displays, and text-heavy content.  

### Typesetting

 U.S. Web Design Standards spacing guidelines are followed for content-heavy pages such as the Help section. Data-heavy pages, such as search results and domain-level display pages, have overall tighter spacing to ensure a good balance of readability to amount of data displayed in a screen view. Users need to be able to quickly scan sets of like items, such as search results, or focus in on specific data elements.
