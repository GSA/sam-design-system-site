<ul>
<li>Autocomplete has dropdown and text entry behavior.  Dropdown behavior shows people their choices.  Text entry makes it easy to filter choices to quickly reach those that are not near the top.</li>
<li>Autocomplete has a gray (#AEB0B5) search icon (fa-search) to the far right, differentiating it from a select or text entry field.</li>
<li>Autocomplete has a default list of values that appear when the component has focus</li>
<li>Autocomplete loses focus as soon as a selection has been made</li>
<li>When a user enters a character, autocomplete reloads its values filtering those which donâ€™t match.  Each use of autocomplete may provide its own matching rules.  By default, any match is accepted with no restrictions.</li>
<li>Autocomplete shows 10 matches at a time with simple display.  If your display is enhanced to take up multiple lines per entry, you may show fewer values.</li>
<li>Autocomplete lets people continuously scroll to see additional matches.</li>
<li>Autocomplete supports customizing the display of each value in the drop down.</li>
</ul>
