<p>Forms should act like forms: Maintain the default browser behavior.</p>
<p>Inline validation: Validating a form or form field prior to submitting the form.</p>
<p>Validators are triggered based on the state of the form control (invalid, valid, dirty, and so on) or length of the form (longer forms have inline validation).
- Invalid fields will not self-correct upon correction by user. Only resubmitting the form will run the validations and change the state of the form control.</p>
<p>Short, long, indefinite alert messages upon form submission:
- Short: 5 seconds.
- Long: 10 seconds.
- Indefinite: default - does not fade.</p>
<p>From submission should result in the user being moved to the top of the form with an alert for added feedback.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Alert notifications of success or other notifications provided to users
