            A workspace landing page provides an entry point for multiple independent categories of information.  It is customized to reflect the type of work done by an individual.  For example, the illustration to the left might be for someone create, edits, or oversees work with pears, bananas, monkeys, apples, and oranges.  There is a workspace element for each type of information (pears, bananas, monkeys, etc) that is the start place for working with that information.  It is important to help someone see quickly which categories or records require their attention or action.

             A review page may be provided during data entry to accompany a multi-page form, giving people a view of all fields on a single page.  The fields will be read only and displayed concisely - not using the real estate that an editor might require.  A review page typically has fields with restricted access which are visible to people who edit and perform reviews.  If all fields are public and there is a “Published View,” a review page may be redundant.
