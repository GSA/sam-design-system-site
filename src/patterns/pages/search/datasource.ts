In some cases, funds can be withheld by the grants Officer under a special award condition requiring the recipient to submit additional environmental compliance information sufficient to enable the DOC to make an assessment on any impacts that a project may have on the environment.\r\n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq.). Recipients of Federal assistance are required to identify to the awarding agency any impact an award will have on the quality of the human environment, and assist the agency in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act when the award activities remain subject to federal authority and control. Applicants for assistance may be requested to assist DOC in drafting an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement if DOC determines such documentation is required.\r\n2. The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.). Recipients of Federal funding are required to identify to the awarding agency any effects the award may have on properties included on or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Recipients may also be requested to assist DOC in consulting with State or Tribal Historic Preservation Officers or other applicable interested parties necessary to identify, assess and resolve adverse effects to historic properties. Until such time as the appropriate NHPA consultations and documentation is complete, funds can be withheld by the Grants Officer under a special award condition requiring the recipient to fully comply with the requirement of the NHPA.\r\n3. Executive Order 11988, May 24, 1977( “Floodplain Management”) and Executive Order 11990, May 24, 1977 (“Protection of Wetlands”). Recipients must identify proposed actions in Federally-defined floodplains and wetlands to enable the Department to make a determination as to whether there is an alternative to minimize any potential harm.\r\n4. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.), Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) (Clean Water Act), and Executive Order 11738 (“Providing for administration of the Clean Air Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act with respect to Federal contracts, grants or loans”). Recipients must comply with the provisions of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 7401 et seq.), Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§1251 et seq.), and Executive Order 11738. Recipients shall not use a facility placed by EPA on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) (http://www.sam.gov) in performing any award that is nonexempt under Subpart J of 2 CFR Part 1532.\r\n5. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. § 4002 et seq.). Flood insurance, when available, is required for Federally-assisted construction or acquisition in flood-prone areas.\r\n6. The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.). Recipients must identify any impact or activities which may involve a threatened or endangered species. Federal agencies have the responsibility to ensure that no adverse effects to a protected species or habitat occur from actions under Federal assistance awards and conduct the required reviews under the Endangered Species Act, as applicable.\r\n7. The Coastal Zone Management Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. § 1451 et seq.). Funded projects must be consistent with a coastal State’s approved management program for the coastal zone.\r\n8. The Coastal Barriers Resources Act (16 U.S.C. § 3501 et seq.). Restrictions are placed on Federal funding for actions within a Coastal Barrier System.\r\n9.

This Act applies to awards that may affect existing or proposed components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system.\r\n10. The Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. §§ 300f-j). This Act precludes Federal assistance for any project that the EPA determines may contaminate a sole-source aquifer so as to threaten public health.\r\n11. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (42 U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq.). This Act regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes. The Act also provides that recipients of Federal funds give preference in their procurement programs to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to EPA guidelines.\r\n12. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund) (42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq.) and the Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act (41 U.S.C. § 11001 et seq.). These requirements address responsibilities of hazardous substance releases, threatened releases, and environmental cleanup. There are also reporting and community involvement requirements designed to ensure disclosure of the release or disposal of regulated substances and cleanup of hazards to state and local emergency responders.\r\n13. Executive Order 12898 (“Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low Income Populations”). Federal agencies are required to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of Federal programs, policies and activities on low income and minority populations.\r\n"}},"_type":"assistanceListing","indexedDate":"2018-02-27T14:30:33-05:00","isFunded":true,"application":{"selectionCriteria":"Research, education and outreach, innovative projects, or sponsorships that address maintaining and improving the viability of marine and coastal ecosystems, for delivering valuable weather, climate, and water information and services, for understanding the science and consequences of climate change, and for supporting the global commerce and transportation."},"modifiedDate":"2017-11-16T05:00:03-05:00","_id":"184aa9fb5b9369c49a65d11b7f57df96","contacts":[{"address":{"zip":"20910","country":"US","streetAddress":"1325 East West Highway, 9th floor, Bldg 2, Room 9328\r\n","city":"Silver Spring","state":"MD"},"phone":"3016281308","name":"Lamar Dwayne Revis","title":"Grants Officer"}]},{"projects":[{"year":"2016","description":"CDC-RFA-CK12-1203 Resident Postdoctoral Fellowship Program in Microbiology\r\n(aka ASM/CDC Program in Infectious Disease and Public Health Microbiology Postdoctoral Research Fellowship)\r\n\r\nCDC-RFA-OE15-1501 APHL-CDC Partnership: Strengthening Public Health Laboratories (EID Fellowship)"},{"year":"2018","description":"CDC-RFA-CK12-1203 Resident Postdoctoral Fellowship Program in Microbiology "},{"year":"2017","description":"CDC-RFA-CK12-1203 Resident Postdoctoral Fellowship Program in Microbiology \r\n"}],"financial":{"additionalInfo":"Program was previously funded under CDC-RFA-CK12-1203.
