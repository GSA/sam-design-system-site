# Structure of our styles

- `sam-design-system` contains any prototype or site-specific (`sam-design-system` only) styles
- `sam-front-end` is a port of current styles from sam-front-end. This is a reference to keep in mind when developing prototypes and patterns
- `sam-styles` contains all styles for finalized patterns. This is our transition goal.
- `reset` contains styles that reset `sam-front-end` in order for `sam-styles` to work correctly
